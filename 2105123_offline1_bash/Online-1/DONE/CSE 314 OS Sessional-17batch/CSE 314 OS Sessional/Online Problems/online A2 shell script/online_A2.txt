You are working in an intelligence agency. Your team has recently received some classified files contained in a folder named "classified_01". These folder contains some secret information of various virology labs around the world. But as there are many sources of information, the files aren't well organized inside this folder. Your boss has given you a file named "keywords.txt" where there are some keywords. Your task is to find all the files containing any keyword and then copy those files to a folder named after the keyword inside a directory named "output". You can assume that a file doesn't contain more than one keyword.
