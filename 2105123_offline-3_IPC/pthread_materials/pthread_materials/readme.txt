1. poisson_random_number_generator.cpp
    - just a simple random number generator from poisson distribution
2. simple_sum_calculation.cpp
    -  a simple sum calculation for a big range of numbers by dividing the job into multiple threads. You can understand the importance of thread joining (explicitly written in code comments, see line 69) and how to manage variables (the partial sum in this case) in case of multi-threaded programming
3. student_report_printing.cpp
    - combines the previous two codes concept and simulates students starting to write a report, writing for a span of time (randomly assigned for each student), then arriving at the print station after they are finished.


For others, file names are quite explanatory
